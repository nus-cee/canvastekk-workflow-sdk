"""Multipart upload machinery for engine upload sessions (DA-2886).

Ported from canvastekk-workflow-nodes ``_shared/cds_multipart.py``
(925-test-pinned patterns DA-2881/2882/2884) with one adaptation: the
control plane is the ENGINE's session endpoints described by an
:class:`~canvastekk_workflow_sdk.uploads.UploadSession` descriptor,
not a CDS client. This module owns the byte-level concerns:

- ETag parsing (S3 returns quoted hex; some S3-compatible stores don't)
- Per-part chunking (seek + read within a single open file handle)
- Per-part Content-MD5 (RFC 1864 raw-MD5 base64 — DA-2891 verdict)
- Per-part retry with backoff (multipart is designed for per-part retry)
- Resume reconciliation (post-retry part failure queries server-side
  upload status and re-attempts only unconfirmed parts — DA-2881)
- Abort-on-failure contract (aborts only when resume is exhausted or
  impossible; NEVER on complete failure)

The orchestrator (:func:`upload_via_session`) opens ONE file handle and
ONE bare httpx client for the duration, pre-reads part chunks
sequentially on the orchestrator thread (``fh.seek()`` on a shared
handle races), and dispatches part PUTs to bounded worker threads in
batches (DA-2882).
