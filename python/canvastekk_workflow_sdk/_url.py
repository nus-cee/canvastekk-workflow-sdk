"""URL policy helpers — SSRF protection for download and upload URLs.

Baseline defense (per PLAN-DA-1711 step 1.1):

- Scheme must be ``https`` (``http`` tolerated only in dev mode).
- Cloud metadata hostnames are blocked outright.
- Hosts are resolved before the request is issued; every resolved IP must
  be public (loopback / private / link-local / reserved / multicast are
  blocked). Hostnames that fail to resolve are allowed through — the
  request itself would fail with the same error, so there is no SSRF
  amplification.
- ``CANVASTEKK_URL_ALLOWLIST`` (comma-separated host suffixes) bypasses
  the IP checks for trusted storage endpoints (e.g. internal MinIO).

Callers enforce per-hop re-validation of redirect targets with
``MAX_REDIRECT_HOPS``. DNS pinning (connecting to the validated IP) is
best-effort and NOT enforced here — ``httpx`` has no first-class
per-request pinning, so a small rebinding window remains and is accepted.
