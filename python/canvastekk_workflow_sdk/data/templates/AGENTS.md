## CanvasTEKK Node Development

This project uses the CanvasTEKK Workflow SDK. When a user asks to create, scaffold, or build a workflow node, follow these routing rules:

### Skill Routing

| User Request Pattern | Skill to Load | When |
|----------------------|---------------|------|
| "Create a workflow node" / "Build a CanvasTEKK node" / "Scaffold a node" | `canvastekk-node-builder` | Always load first for any node creation task |
| "How do I use InstanceSet/MeasurementSet/PlaneSet?" | `canvastekk-node-patterns` | Load for domain-specific patterns and examples |
| "Create a point cloud segmentation node" | `canvastekk-node-builder` + `canvastekk-node-patterns` | Load both — builder for workflow, patterns for domain example |
| "Add auth/middleware/webhooks to my node" | `canvastekk-node-patterns` | Load for advanced integration patterns |
| "Review my node" / "Validate my handler" | `canvastekk-node-builder` | Load for the validation checklist |

### Node Creation Conventions

When creating CanvasTEKK workflow nodes, always follow these rules:

1. **Use `canvastekk-workflow-sdk` from GitHub Packages or GitHub Releases**: `pip install canvastekk-workflow-sdk --index-url https://USERNAME:TOKEN@pypi.pkg.github.com/nus-cee/` (requires PAT with `read:packages` scope), OR download the wheel directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nus-cee/canvastekk-workflow-sdk/releases)
2. **File fields use `format: "file"` with `type: "string"`**: Never use `format: "binary"` or `type: "object"` on file fields — the SDK's model_validator rejects them
3. **Include `x-accept` and `x-maxSizeBytes`** on every file input field — the SDK auto-validates downloaded files against these constraints
4. **File inputs are auto-downloaded by the SDK**: The SDK downloads presigned URL file inputs to `context.downloads_dir` before calling `execute()`. Node authors receive local file paths, not URLs. Manual download with `httpx.stream()` is only needed for non-file URLs or opt-out scenarios.
5. **Write outputs to `context.output_path(filename)`**: Never hardcode paths; return them as `str(output_path)`
6. **`definition` must be both module-level AND class attribute**: Module-level enables CLI validation; class attribute satisfies `BaseNode.__init_subclass__`
7. **Node IDs follow `{name}-v{version}` format**: e.g., `segment-v1.0.0`
8. **Report progress with `context.report_progress()`**: At key stages (process, save)
9. **Always generate Dockerfile + pyproject.toml + tests**: A complete node project includes all four files
